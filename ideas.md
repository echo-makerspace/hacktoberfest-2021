# Hacktoberfest ideas:

## [Lesebot](https://github.com/lesesalen/lesebot)
 - Convert bot to Python / Java
   - *Currently ongoing*
 - Use TP API for courseplans per course combination:
   - `!timeplan INF100,MAT122,INF312`
   - `!courseplan ...`
 - Personal reminders on courses:
   - Send reminder DM specified amount of time before course
   - `!alarm INF122 30m`
 - Information about what rooms a specific course is held in
   - `!whereis INF234`
 - Location of different rooms
   - `!where Auditorium 3`
   - **Done**
 - Food newsletter group command, to let interested people cooperate on food orders
   - `!foodsquad` to opt-in
   - `!food "message"` to send message to everyone opted-in
 - Discord bot betting game
   - `!bet <amount>`
   - `!points` / `!stonks`
 - Give the bot a database
   - Ex.: SQLite
   - (Currently uses shitty JSON files for storage)
 - Bot randomly jumps into voice channels and plays a *spooky* sound (ex.: a "doot")

## [Lesesalen.com](https://www.lesesalen.com)
 - Add more notes
   - Ex.: INF161, DAT250, INF234, 
 - Make it pretty :) (Sorry Mathias)
 - POTW (Playlist of The Week)
   - Possibly easiest PR on this list
